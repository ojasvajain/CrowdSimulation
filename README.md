# CrowdSimulation
In this work we describe a GPU implementation for an individual-based model for fish schooling. In this model each fish aligns its position and orientation
with an appropriate average of its neighbours positions and orientations.

OpenCL,OpenGL,C,Visual Studio were used for making the project. More details can be found in the report.
